# ChatEncrypted
An encrypted chatbot.

This project's goal was to create a secure social networking application. 
Only members of a secure group should be able to decode each other's postings in the secure social app.
The post should display as ciphertext to all other users of the system. 
For the encryption I used Diffie- Hellman's Algorithm for key encryption and AES to encrypt the messages.
